# SFML TextBox
___

This project is a data structures visualization tool built with SFML in C++. It includes visualizations for various data structures and algorithms, including linked lists, sorting algorithms, trees, and hash tables.

## Description 
The project is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific feature:

- `System`: This is the main class that handles events, updates the system, and draws the system.
- `AnimateTrees`: This class is responsible for animating tree data structures.
- `AnimatedLinkedList`: This class is responsible for animating linked list data structures.
- `AnimatedSortAlg`: This class is responsible for animating sorting algorithms.
- `AnimatedHashtable`: This class is responsible for animating hash table data structures.

Each module includes various functionalities and can be interacted with through the user interface.

## Implemented Features
- [x] Linked List
- [x] Sorting Algorithms
- [x] Trees
- [x] Hash Tables
- [x] Text Box
- [x] Blinking Cursor
- [x] Text Box that can be used to display text
- [x] Displays all the data structures and algorithms in a window
- [x] User can interact with the data structures and algorithms using the keyboard and mouse
- [x] User can add, delete, and search for elements in the data structures
- [x] Zoom in and out of the data structures

## Future Features
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Linear Interpolation
- [ ] Zoom on specific points in the data structures
- [ ] User can change the color of the data structures
- [ ] 3D visualization of the data structures
